        <p>Part(s) that give the most pain during this assignment?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Got to be Task 9. I just could not figure the right query to get the total mutual friends</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>What things that can be improve in the future?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some of the things can definitly be improved would be try to spread out the functions.php as of right now<br>
            it is to clump together. I would try to make this assignment as a true OO (Object Oriented) program. As some of<br>
            the functions could be improved and can be handled a whole lot better.
